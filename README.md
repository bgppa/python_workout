Simple-but-effective exercises from the book "Python Workout".

I've always tried to improve my programming skills.
It is said that one should join a big project, follow advanced courses and be active on social media.
Nothing worked in my case.
I lack a clear goal and I have a life full of multiple interests that keep me awake.

Therefore my new approach: in silence, I keep repeating the basics, until mastering them.
This repository is for me, but the reader is very welcome.

Have a good day
